# Executive summary

This paper explores the relationship between miles per US gallon and type of 
transmission, using the mtcars dataset in R.

Our analysis showed that manual transmission is better than automatic in regards to
MPG. While accounting for number of cylinders, horsepower and weight, cars with 
automatic tranmission have 1.8 higher MPG than those with manual.

# Data pre-processing

```{r preproc}
my_data <- mtcars
head(my_data)

# Transform variables to factors where appropriate
my_data$cyl <- factor(my_data$cyl)
my_data$vs <- factor(my_data$vs)
my_data$am <- factor(my_data$am, labels = c("auto", "man"))
my_data$gear <- factor(my_data$gear, labels = c("3", "4", "5"))
my_data$carb <- factor(my_data$carb)
```

# 1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
Let's get a first idea about the difference in average MPG between automatic and 
manual transmissions:

```{r agr}
aggregate(my_data[, 1], list(my_data$am), mean)
```

There seems to be a clear difference (7.25 MPG) in the average mpg between automatic
and manual transmission (see appendix for plot). Let's confirm it with a hypothesis test.

H_0: There is no significant difference in mpg between auto and man trans.

H_1: Automatic transmission is associated with lower values of mpg

```{r ttest}
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = my_data, paired = FALSE, alt = "less")$p.value
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = my_data, paired = FALSE, alt = "less")$estimate
```

The p-value is 0.0007 which means that we reject the null at any reasonable
significance level, i.e. Manual transmission is better for MPG. 

# 2. Quantify the MPG difference between types of transmission.

We've fit several linear regression models to quantify the difference in MPG between automatic and manual type of transmission.

The final model is shown below. The full model selection strategy and intermediate 
models can be found in the Appendix.

```{r model3}
mdl3 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt + am, data = my_data)

summary(mdl3)$coef
summary(mdl3)[8:9]
```

In addition to the type of transmission, this model takes into account the number
of cylinders, horsepower and weight. The model can explain 87% of total variance
in MPG. While keeping all other variables constant, MPG increases by 1.8 miles/gallon 
from automatic to manual transmission.

# Diagnostics

The results of the diagnostic tests are shown below. See Appendix for plots.

1. The residual vs fitted plot does not reveal any non-linear or other patterns
2. Testing the normality assumption - the qqplot is not a perfect straight line but does not appear to be concerning
3. There is no evidence of heteroscedasticity from the scale-location plot
4. All the residuals are within Cook's distance, so there's no reason to suspect
influential data points in the dataset.

##1. Boxplot of MPG by type of transmission
```{r box, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
require(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = am, y = mpg))
g + geom_boxplot(aes(group = am), fill = "olivedrab1") +
        xlab("transmission type") + 
        ylab("miles/(US) gallon") + 
        ggtitle("Miles/(US) gallon by type of transmission")
```

##3. Model selection strategy and intermediate models

**Model1**

First try a simple linear regression model with MPG as the dependent variable 
and transmission type (am) as the independent.

```{r model1}
mdl1 <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = my_data)
summary(mdl1)
```

From the summary we can see that am seems to have a significant effect on mpg
(p-value < 0.05), and the difference in average MPG between the two levels of am
(manual - auto) is 7.245, which matches the difference we've already observed. However,
am alone does not appear to be enough to explain the variation in mpg, the R-squared
is 0.3598, which means that this model can only explain 36% of the total variation
in mpg. We will try to add some more independent variables to the model from the
dataset to try and get a better fit.

Let's have a look at the correlations between mpg and the other variables in the
dataset. We'll try a model that includes variables that appear to be highly
correlated with mpg. Let's pick arbitratily the variables that have an absolute
correlation higher than 0.7 plus the am variable.

**Model2**
```{r model2}
cor(mtcars, method = "pearson")[, "mpg"]
mdl2 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + wt + am, data = my_data)
summary(mdl2)
```

Model 2 explains 87% of the variance and the adjusted R-squared is 83%. It 
is a much better fit than model 1, but includes independent variables that don't
seem to have a significant effect (variables with p-value higher than 0.05).
Transmission type doesn't seem to be significant in this model either. Let's try
to remove variable "disp".
